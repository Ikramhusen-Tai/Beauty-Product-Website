    <button class="accordion">CODE OF CONDUCT</button>
    <div class="accordion-panel">
      <p>
        Where applicable on the Services (e.g., on message boards), you are invited to post your
        own content (“User Content”). You understand that all User Content, whether you have
        publicly posted on a forum, posted as part of your profile, or privately transmitted to
        another Service user or to us, is your sole responsibility. Though the Services are
        designed to be a safe place to share such User Content, the Company cannot guarantee
        that other users will not misuse the User Content that you share. If you have any User
        Content that you would like to keep confidential and/or do not want others to use
        (including but not limited to, photos, personal information, name, home address,
        telephone number, etc.), do not post it to the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under no circumstances will the Company be liable in any way for any User Content,
        including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any User Content, or for any
        loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any User Content posted,
        emailed or otherwise transmitted via the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        By posting any User Content at the Services, you hereby grant the Company a
        royalty-free, fully paid up, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully
        sub-licensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate,
        combine with other works, create derivative works from, distribute, perform, edit and
        display such User Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other
        works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed.
      </p>
      <p>
        You specifically waive any “moral rights” in and to the User Content. The foregoing
        grant includes, without limitation, any copyrights and other intellectual property
        rights in and to your User Content. You represent and warrant that: you own the User
        Content posted by you on or through the Services or otherwise have the right to grant
        the license set forth in this Section; and the posting of your User Content on or
        through the Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights,
        contract rights or any other rights of any person.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by
        reason of any User Content you posted to or through the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that the Company may preserve User Content and may also
        disclose or use User Content within its discretion. You understand that the technical
        processing and transmission of the Services, including your User Content, may involve:
        transmissions over various networks; and changes to conform and adapt to technical
        requirements of connecting networks or devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree to each of the conditions in this Agreement and further agree that each of
        these conditions applies forever and broadly with regard to the Company worldwide.
        Posting of User Content to or through the Services, including ideas or disclosures of
        opinions, is voluntary on your part. No confidential or additional contractual
        relationship is established by your posting of User Content or is to be implied by our
        review or subsequent use of your User Content. The Company shall not be liable for any
        disclosure of any User Content, including opinion(s) or suggestion(s), you post to or
        through the Services.
      </p>
